              Thanks to our vast experience in B2B lead generation, we begin
              with an initial interview where we assess several key factors: the
              typical cost of a lead in your industry, the probability of
              closing these leads, and the average lifetime value of your
              customers. Based on this information, we calculate what is
              necessary to ensure a positive ROI for you. We will only provide a
              quote if we are confident we can deliver leads at the agreed price
              that align with your business goals.
